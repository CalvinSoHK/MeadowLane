Hey there!
I'm glad you finally made to East Lula :)
I'm surprised you went with a house on Meadow Lane, though I guess there aren't other places that come with a farm...
Can you see it from your window? Must be a nice sight in the morning
Actually, why don't you try going there now
Holding down on the controller's trigger will enable you to interact with objects
Just point towards the door to your farm and press the trigger to go there!
Oh! And if you want to put your phone away, just press the menu button
If you want to review this conversation, you can bring your phone back up by pressing up on the D-Pad.

Nice!
Looks like you already have a couple farm plots ready to go.
If you press down on your D-Pad you will open up your inventory
Just take out your tools and start farming :)
You can navigate through your inventory by using the D-Pad.
Up and Down will change the category, while left and right will change the items.
If you press on the center of your D-Pad, you will equip whatever item you are currently selecting.
Now then, you should start growing something :)
There should be some seeds lying around here somewhere.
But make sure to hit the dirt with your hoe to plant the seeds properly.
And remember, your plants need to be watered everyday if you want them to grow!
Once you are done, you can put the seed packet in your inventory (the floating barrel around you) and then go to bed :)
