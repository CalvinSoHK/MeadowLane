Hey there!
Tired of farming? If you stick around, I'm sure our chef will be able to prepare something tasty...
I hope...

Maybe if I work hard enough-
I'll have a restaurant of my own...

What recipe should I teach them next?
Maybe they should learn about candied tomatoes.
You'd think they would already know that one...

Listen, I'll be honest with you.
Our chef can't cook to save his life.
You need to help me make the right dishes for our clients
But our chef can't know about it.
I'll give you a bunch of ingredients, as if that is what you ordered
It's up to you to put the right ones in the pot whithout the chef noticing you.
I'll be around if you need help.
So what do you think?
Will you help me make the right dishes for our customers?
